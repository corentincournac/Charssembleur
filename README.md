# Charssembleur

A very strange assembly interpreter I worte in my youth for a programming contest. You can find the source here.
If you are a linux user on an x86 machine, or a windows user, you may run the binary directly.
Packed up with some already written programs, .prog files. Some are commented (in French), some are not.

If you want to write your own programs, you may read the manual ("manuel.pdf"). WARNING : French
There is a makefile in the 'source' folder.

Have fun !
